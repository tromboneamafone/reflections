When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository with all the code, projects, & text that I want to keep public and avaiable for others to see/work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I imagain if there are local changes that have not been pushed, automatically trying to pull could create some code inconsistancies that need to be carefully merged.
